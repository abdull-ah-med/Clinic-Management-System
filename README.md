# Clinic Management System
## About this Project
### Introduction
Clinic Management System aims at providing efficient and robust solutions for working the daily base working for clinic. This Application is designed to handle and serve multiple type of users such as Doctors, Patient, Patient Employees etc. It ensures efficient communication between all of the clinic staff, and the clinic's communication with other departments as well.
### Technology / Languages Used
1. C# : This application is based upon C# language and the frontend of this application is built using WinForms implementation of C# Language.
2. SQL : SQL is used for efficient and robust data queries, retrieval and handling.
3. Database : Database for this project is locally stored, implemented using Microsoft SQL Server Management.
### Database Design
The goal for the Database is to store data efficiently, reduce data redundancy, proper implementation of keys in Database to avoid data inconsistencies. Following are tables created in this Database
1. Users
2. Doctors
3. Patients
4. DoctorPatientMapping
5. PatientAttendants
6. Appointments
7. Visits
8. VisitPrescriptions
9. Medicines
10. LaboratoryTests
11. Departments
12. HospitalStaff
13. Offices
14. InsuranceCompanies
15. PatientInsurance
16. HospitalBill
17. PaymentMethod
18. PatientRooms
### Programming Principles & Fundamentals.
As the requirement demand robust working of this project, therefore fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Efficient Algorithms (were needed) were implemented to make sure that the application was developed and implemented in most efficient way possible.
### About Implementation
This Application is a Desktop Stand-Alone Application
### Future Plans
Future plans for this project include using an online Database, or a local server approach, therefore making the Database accessible for multiple end-users. Developer can also improve or add features, as needed.

### About the Course
This Project is part of my Database Systems Course (CS-262) in 4th Semester. The main purpose of this course is to familiarise the students with Database Concepts such as Database Design, Implementation, Management and making it Efficient. This course has a Pre-Requisite of Data Structures and Algorithms. This course is divided into sub-sections such as:
#### 1. SQL & Relational Algebra
This includes concepts related with SQL such as Joins, Aggregated Functions, Sub-Queries, Grouping, Nested Queries and so on. It also includes concepts like Relational Algebra, Projection, Constraints, Views, Transactions, etc.
#### 2. Design Theory
This includes concepts such as Functional Dependencies, Keys, Normal Forms (Boyce Codd, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF.
#### 3. Query Optimization
This includes Transaction Locking, Concurrency Control, Coping with System Failures and Transaction Logging.
#### 4. Semi Structured Data
This includes XML, JSON, NoSQL DB, OLAP.
